   abstract = {Examples of NHANES data NHANES collects data on a variety of health-related topics, including: NHANES data help produce national references for such measurements as height and weight (pediatric growth charts) and blood pressure. Recent NHANES findings Prevalence of hypertension among adults Hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 80 mmHg, or currently taking medication to lower high blood pressure) is a public health challenge in the United States because it directly increases the risk for cardiovascular disease.  During the survey period 2017-2018, the prevalence of age-adjusted hypertension was 45.4% among adults, and was higher among men (51.0%) than women (39.7%).  Hypertension prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black (57.1%) than non-Hispanic white (43.6%) or Hispanic (43.7) adults.  Overall, hypertension prevalence decreased from 47.0% in 1999-2000 to 41.7% in 2013-2014, and then increased to 45.4% in 2017-2018. Prevalence of hypertension among adults aged 18 and over, by sex and age: United States, 2017-2018 1 Significantly different from women within the same age group. 2 Significant increasing trend by age. NOTES: Estimates for age group 18 and over are age adjusted by the direct method to the U.S. Census 2000 population using age groups 18-39, 40-59, and 60 and over. Crude estimates are 48.2% for all persons, 52.5% for men, and 44.0% for women. Access data table for this figure at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db364-tables-508.pdf#1.

   abstract = {Importance: Changes in the economy, nutrition policies, and food processing methods can affect dietary macronutrient intake and diet quality. It is essential to evaluate trends in dietary intake, food sources, and diet quality to inform policy makers. Objective: To investigate trends in dietary macronutrient intake, food sources, and diet quality among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Serial cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (1999-2016) among adults aged 20 years or older. Exposure: Survey cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dietary intake of macronutrients and their subtypes, food sources, and the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been defined). Results: There were 43996 respondents (weighted mean age, 46.9 years; 51.9% women). From 1999 to 2016, the estimated energy from total carbohydrates declined from 52.5% to 50.5% (difference, -2.02%; 95% CI, -2.41% to -1.63%), whereas that of total protein and total fat increased from 15.5% to 16.4% (difference, 0.82%; 95% CI, 0.67%-0.97%) and from 32.0% to 33.2% (difference, 1.20%; 95% CI, 0.84%-1.55%), respectively (all P <.001 for trend). Estimated energy from low-quality carbohydrates decreased by 3.25% (95% CI, 2.74%-3.75%; P <.001 for trend) from 45.1% to 41.8%. Increases were observed in estimated energy from high-quality carbohydrates (by 1.23% [95% CI, 0.84%-1.61%] from 7.42% to 8.65%), plant protein (by 0.38% [95% CI, 0.28%-0.49%] from 5.38% to 5.76%), saturated fatty acids (by 0.36% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.51%] from 11.5% to 11.9%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (by 0.65% [95% CI, 0.56%-0.74%] from 7.58% to 8.23%) (all P <.001 for trend). The estimated overall Healthy Eating Index 2015 increased from 55.7 to 57.7 (difference, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.86-3.16; P <.001 for trend). Trends in high- and low-quality carbohydrates primarily reflected higher estimated energy from whole grains (0.65%) and reduced estimated energy from added sugars (-2.00%), respectively. Trends in plant protein were predominantly due to higher estimated intake of whole grains (0.12%) and nuts (0.09%). Conclusions and Relevance: From 1999 to 2016, US adults experienced a significant decrease in percentage of energy intake from low-quality carbohydrates and significant increases in percentage of energy intake from high-quality carbohydrates, plant protein, and polyunsaturated fat. Despite improvements in macronutrient composition and diet quality, continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remained..},
